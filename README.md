# Hello
I'm Harsha!

I'm a PhD student learning and researching about **machine learning**, **signal processing**, **speech technology**, **conversational AI**, and **LLM applications**. My work focuses on conversational AI.

## Current Research
I'm exploring **enchronic speech dynamics** using **self-supervised learning** and working on **bias detection in conversational AI**. Enchrony involves studying:
- How quickly we respond in conversations.
- How we co-create meaning with our conversation partners.
- Other real-time interaction dynamics.

My goal is to uncover insights that advance our understanding of human communication and improve conversational AI systems.

## Past Work
- **Masterâ€™s in Electrical Engineering (Signal Processing)**: Built **automatic speech recognition (ASR)** models for literacy assessments in India, now in field use by an NGO.
- **MSc in Data Science & AI**: Deepened my expertise in machine learning and AI.
- **Industry Experience**:
  - Developed **speech assessment systems** and **voice activity detectors**.
  - Built **LLM-based solutions** for the aerospace industry, including a **RAG-based system** that automated repair scheme creation, saving engineers 98% of their time.

## What Drives Me
I love tackling tough problems and finding unique solutions that push projects forward or take them to the next level.

## General Interests
- Signal Processing
- Speech Technology
- Conversational AI
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
